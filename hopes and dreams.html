       We want our future business to at first start out small then grow bigger. Our hopes are that we will not have to rent land or buildings. We would like to use shipping containers like this as our HQ.
       <br><br>
       <img src="" alt="Pic of the layout of the shipping containers">
       <br><br>
       The bottom middle container will be the front desk type area and if you were standing in front of the containers than the bottom right one would be our offices where we would do all of our personal experiments.

       <h1><span class="class a">Web shooters</span></h1>

       <br>
       <div class="all-divs">
       My friend and I were walking up and down the sidewalk brain-storming on how to make web shooters like Spider-Mans (ones that somebody could actually shoot and then hang on and/or swing from). In this section of the page we will be telling you about how we might achieve this.
       First we are goimg to take spiders and study how their body's make webs. Then we will try to make a mechanical version (of the organ that creates the web, we would NOT do the whole body) and hopefully downsize it so that it will fit on the wrists. Also we would genetically modify the web so that in 45 mins or so it will dissolve into a water-like substance.

       <h1><span class="class a">Teleportation Devices</span></h1>
       <br>
       <br>
       <div class="all-divs">
       I have not studied much on how someone might teleport matter but I do have one idea and, it's that maybe if we could basically chop something up into a million digital little pieces and then send them (using wi-fi) to something that would then put all of those tiny digital pieces together then it might work but, that's not the problem. the problem is figuring out how to do that.

       <h1><span class="class a">hoverboards</span></h1>
       <div class="all-divs">
       I want to make two types of hoverboards; one that uses electromagnets to hover(which will be called electroboards), and one that uses propellers. These will be called proboards.
       </div>
       <br>
       <h3 class="eb hover">electroboards</h3>
       <br>
       <div class="all-divs">
       First I will tell you (the reader) how one would craft a Solenoid which, is an electromagnet. If you coil a magnet wire, put a an iorn rod in the middle and, send electricity though the coiled magnet wire it will then produce a magnetic field. This is a solnoid. In the following paragrafs I will be sharing how we are going to make it. 
       For about three years I've been thinkin about how extreamly awesome it would be if I constructed a device with the ability to be screwed onto a SkateBoard (in the place of the trucks which, are what the wheeles are atached to) that would allow the Skateboard to float while a human is standing on it. for this I will use Solenoids. To turn you would have to lean to the side. I suppose I will have to program a sensore to do that. 
       </div>
       <br>
       <h3 class="eb hover">proboards</h3>
       <br>
       <div class="all-divs">
       Okay now like I said I am going to make two types of hoverboards so lets jump into the second one!

       </div>
       <br>
       <div class="all-divs">
        This paragraph probobly should not even be called a paragraph. I want the two hoverboards to be the same except that the probaords will use motors and of course propelrs. They will bacicly be drones that you can stand on.
